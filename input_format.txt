Floorplan input format & design
•	The format will be in a csv format
•	Each field will be delimited by a comma
•	In each field, multiple items are possible:
  o	Clean floor
  o	Dirty floor
  o	Obstacle
  o	Charging station
  
•	If a floor is present (anything other than obstacle and charging station) then a type of floor would need to be defined (1 for bare, 2 for low-pile carpet, 3 for high-pile carpet, 0 for not a floor)
•	A sample field (unit of floorspace) would be in the following format:
  o	Floor | obstacle | charging station | Clean or Dirty? | Floor type
  o	Examples: 
    	0|1|0|0|0 for a field that is an obstacle
    	0|0|1|0|0 for a field that is a charging station
    	1|0|0|1|3 for a field that is a high-pile carpet floor that is clean
    
Floor possible values:
  •	0 = no floor
  •	1 = floor
Obstacle possible values:
  •	0 = no obstacle
  •	1 = obstacle
Obstacle possible values:
  •	0 = no charging station
  •	1 = charging station
Clean or Dirty? Possible values:
  •	0 = not a floor so N/A
  •	1 = clean floor
  •	2 = dirty floor
Floor type possible values:
  •	0 = not a floor so N/A
  •	1 = bare floor
  •	2 = low-pile carpet
  •	3= high pile carpet
